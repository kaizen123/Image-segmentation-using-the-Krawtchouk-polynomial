Description:
Among the prevalent approaches in image's region segmentation, illumination level probability distribution function has
been given prominent attention. Normally, there is a constant definition of illumination level probability distribution
function in the basic forms of the mentioned approach. This constant definition causes the algorithms in this area
encounter a severe challenge. This paper presents the use of Krawtchouk polynomial to improve the estimation of the
intensity illumination function. The orthogonal terms of the Krawtchouk polynomial are considered as eigen functions of
differential equations. They provide a more stable estimation in describing the image's illumination levels
differentiations against environmental noises. Therefore, utilizing image stabilization functions, such as Gaussian
two-dimensional filters are reduced. As a consequence, the Krawtchouk polynomial is an appropriate estimator of the
illumination function for the foreground and background object in a wide variety of images. Verification results on
synthesis and natural images conformed the proposed claim. The results suggest that both the proposed approach and best
current solutions function are equally in the noise-free environment rather than environmental noises. Nevertheless, in
the presence of imposing noise, the proposed approach maintains its accuracy and stability.
